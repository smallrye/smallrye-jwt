= Generate JWT Tokens

JWT claims can be signed or encrypted or signed first and the nested JWT token encrypted. Signing the claims is used
most often to secure the claims. What is known today as a JWT token is typically produced by signing the claims in a
JSON format using the steps described in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515[JSON Web Signature] specification.
However, when the claims are sensitive, their confidentiality can be guaranteed by following the steps described in the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516[JSON Web Encryption] specification to produce a JWT token with the encrypted claims.
Finally both the confidentiality and integrity of the claims can be further enforced by signing them first and then
encrypting the nested JWT token.

SmallRye JWT project provides a JWT Build API for securing the JWT claims using all of these options.

== Maven dependency

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-jwt-build</artifactId>
  <version>${smallrye.jwt.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Create JwtClaimsBuilder and set the claims

The first step is to initialize a `JwtClaimsBuilder` using one of the options below and add some claims to it:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.Collections;
import io.smallrye.jwt.build.Jwt;
import io.smallrye.jwt.build.JwtClaimsBuilder;
...
// Create an empty builder and add some claims
JwtClaimsBuilder builder1 = Jwt.claims();
builder1.claim("customClaim", "custom-value").issuer("https://issuer.org");
// Or start typing the claims immediately:
// JwtClaimsBuilder builder1 = Jwt.upn("Alice");

// Builder created from the existing claims
JwtClaimsBuilder builder2 = Jwt.claims("/tokenClaims.json");

// Builder created from a map of claims
JwtClaimsBuilder builder3 = Jwt.claims(Collections.singletonMap("customClaim", "custom-value"));

// Builder created from JsonObject
JsonObject userName = Json.createObjectBuilder().add("username", "Alice").build();
JsonObject userAddress = Json.createObjectBuilder().add("city", "someCity").add("street", "someStreet").build();
JsonObject json = Json.createObjectBuilder(userName).add("address", userAddress).build();
JwtClaimsBuilder builder4 = Jwt.claims(json);

// Builder created from JsonWebToken
@Inject JsonWebToken token;
JwtClaimsBuilder builder5 = Jwt.claims(token);
----

The API is fluent so the builder initialization can be done as part of the fluent API sequence. The builder will also
set `iat (issued at) claim to the current time, `exp`(expires at) claim to a sum of the `iat` claim and `smallrye.jwt.new-token.lifespan`
property values and `jti` (unique token identifier) claim if they have not already been set, so one can skip setting them when possible.

The next step is to decide how to secure the claims.

== Sign the claims

The claims can be signed immediately or after the `JSON Web Signature` headers have been set:

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.jwt.build.Jwt;
...

// Sign the claims using the private key loaded from the location set with a 'smallrye.jwt.sign.key-location' property.
// No 'jws()' transition is necessary.
String jwt1 = Jwt.claims("/tokenClaims.json").sign();

// Set the headers and sign the claims with an RSA private key loaded in the code (the implementation of this method is omitted). Note a 'jws()' transition to a 'JwtSignatureBuilder'.
String jwt2 = Jwt.claims("/tokenClaims.json").jws().keyId("kid1").header("custom-header", "custom-value").sign(getPrivateKey());
----

Note the `alg` (algorithm) header is set to `RS256` by default.

== Encrypt the claims

The claims can be encrypted immediately or after the `JSON Web Encryption` headers have been set the same way as they
can be signed. The only minor difference is that encrypting the claims always requires a `jwe() JwtEncryptionBuilder`
transition:

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.jwt.build.Jwt;
...

// Encrypt the claims using the public key loaded from the location set with a 'smallrye.jwt.encrypt.key-location' property.
String jwt1 = Jwt.claims("/tokenClaims.json").jwe().encrypt();

// Set the headers and encrypt the claims with an RSA public key loaded in the code (the implementation of this method is omitted).
String jwt2 = Jwt.claims("/tokenClaims.json").jwe().header("custom-header", "custom-value").encrypt(getPublicKey());
----

Note the `alg` (key management algorithm) header is set to `RSA-OAEP-256` (it will be changed to `RSA-OAEP` in a future
version of smallrye-jwt) and the `enc` (content encryption header) is set to `A256GCM` by default.

== Sign the claims and encrypt the nested JWT token

The claims can be signed and then the nested JWT token encrypted by combining the sign and encrypt steps.

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.jwt.build.Jwt;
...

// Sign the claims and encrypt the nested token using the private and public keys loaded from the locations set with the 'smallrye.jwt.sign.key-location' and 'smallrye.jwt.encrypt.key-location' properties respectively.
String jwt = Jwt.claims("/tokenClaims.json").innerSign().encrypt();
----

=== Fast JWT Generation

If `smallrye.jwt.sign.key-location` or/and `smallrye.jwt.encrypt.key-location` properties are set then one can secure the existing claims (resources, maps, JsonObjects) with a single call:
```
// More compact than Jwt.claims("/claims.json").sign();
Jwt.sign("/claims.json");

// More compact than Jwt.claims("/claims.json").jwe().encrypt();
Jwt.encrypt("/claims.json");

// More compact than Jwt.claims("/claims.json").innerSign().encrypt();
Jwt.signAndEncrypt("/claims.json");
```
As mentioned above, `iat`, `exp`, `jti` and `iss` claims will be added if needed.

== Configuration

Smallrye JWT supports the following properties which can be used to customize the way claims are signed and encrypted:

[cols="<m,<m,<2",options="header"]
|===
|Property Name|Default|Description
|smallrye.jwt.encrypt.key.location|none|Location of a key which will be used to encrypt the claims or inner JWT when a no-argument encrypt() method is called.
|smallrye.jwt.encrypt.key-location|none|Location of a key which will be used to encrypt the claims or inner JWT when a no-argument encrypt() method is called. This property is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
|smallrye.jwt.sign.key.location|none|Location of a key which will be used to sign the claims when either a no-argument sign() or innerSign() method is called.
|smallrye.jwt.sign.key-location|none|Location of a key which will be used to sign the claims when either a no-argument sign() or innerSign() method is called. This property is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
|smallrye.jwt.new-token.lifespan|300|Token lifespan in seconds which will be used to calculate an `exp` (expiry) claim value if this claim has not already been set.
|smallrye.jwt.new-token.issuer|none|Token issuer which can be used to set an `iss` (issuer) claim value if this claim has not already been set.
|smallrye.jwt.new-token.audience|none|Token audience which can be used to set an `aud` (audience) claim value if this claim has not already been set.
|smallrye.jwt.new-token.override-matching-claims|false|Override the existing `iss` or `aud` claim values if `smallrye.jwt.new-token.issuer` or `smallrye.jwt.new-token.audience` properties are set.
