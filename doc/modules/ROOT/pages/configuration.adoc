== MicroProfile JWT properties

[cols="<m,<m,<2",options="header"]
|===
|Property Name|Default|Description
|mp.jwt.verify.publickey|none|Public Key supplied as a string, parsed from it in the order defined in section <<Supported Public Key Formats>>.
|mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location|none|Config property allows for an external or internal location of Public Key to be specified.
|mp.jwt.verify.issuer|none|Expected value of the JWT `iss` (issuer) claim.
|mp.jwt.token.header|`Authorization`|Set this property if another header such as `Cookie` is used to pass the token.
|mp.jwt.token.cookie|`Bearer`|Name of the cookie containing a token. This property will be effective only if  `mp.jwt.token.header` is set to `Cookie`.
|mp.jwt.verify.audiences|`none`|Comma separated list of the audiences that a token `aud` claim may contain.
|===

== Supported Public Key Formats

Public Keys may be formatted in any of the following formats, specified in order of
precedence:

- Public Key Cryptography Standards #8 (PKCS#8) PEM
- JSON Web Key (JWK) or JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)
- Base64 URL encoded JSON Web Key (JWK) or JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)

== Smallrye JWT properties

Smallrye JWT supports many properties which can be used to customize the token processing:

[cols="<m,<m,<2",options="header"]
|===
|Property Name|Default|Description
|smallrye.jwt.verify.algorithm|`RS256`|Signature algorithm. Set it to `ES256` to support the Elliptic Curve signature algorithm.
|smallrye.jwt.verify.key-format|`ANY`|Set this property to a specific key format such as `PEM_KEY`, `PEM_CERTIFICATE`, `JWK` or `JWK_BASE64URL` to optimize the way the verification key is loaded.
|smallrye.jwt.token.header|`Authorization`|Set this property if another header such as `Cookie` is used to pass the token.This property is deprecated. Use `mp.jwt.token.header` instead.
|smallrye.jwt.token.cookie|`Bearer`|Name of the cookie containing a token. This property will be effective only if  `smallrye.jwt.token.header` is set to `Cookie`. This property is deprecated. Use `mp.jwt.token.cookie` instead.
|smallrye.jwt.always-check-authorization|false|Set this property to `true` for `Authorization` header be checked even if the `smallrye.jwt.token.header` is set to `Cookie` but no cookie with a `smallrye.jwt.token.cookie` name exists.
|smallrye.jwt.token.schemes|`Bearer`|Comma-separated list containing an alternative single or multiple schemes, for example, `DPoP`.
|smallrye.jwt.token.kid|none|Key identifier. If it is set then the verification JWK key as well every JWT token must have a matching `kid` header.
|smallrye.jwt.time-to-live|none|The maximum number of seconds that a JWT may be issued for use. Effectively, the difference between the expiration date of the JWT and the issued at date must not exceed this value.
|smallrye.jwt.require.named-principal|`false`|If an application relies on `java.security.Principal` returning a name then a token must have a `upn` or `preferred_username` or `sub` claim set. Setting this property will result in Smallrye JWT throwing an exception if none of these claims is available for the application code to reliably deal with a non-null `Principal` name.
|smallrye.jwt.path.sub|none|Path to the claim containing the subject name. It starts from the top level JSON object and can contain multiple segments where each segment represents a JSON object name only, example: `realms/subject`. This property can be used if a token has no 'sub' claim but has the subject set in a different claim. Use double quotes with the namespace qualified claims.
|smallrye.jwt.claims.sub|none| This property can be used to set a default sub claim value when the current token has no standard or custom `sub` claim available. Effectively this property can be used to customize `java.security.Principal` name if no `upn` or `preferred_username` or `sub` claim is set.
|smallrye.jwt.path.groups|none|Path to the claim containing the groups. It starts from the top level JSON object and can contain multiple segments where each segment represents a JSON object name only, example: `realm/groups`. This property can be used if a token has no 'groups' claim but has the groups set in a different claim. Use double quotes with the namespace qualified claims.
|smallrye.jwt.groups-separator|' '|Separator for splitting a string which may contain multiple group values. It will only be used if the `smallrye.jwt.path.groups` property points to a custom claim whose value is a string. The default value is a single space because a standard OAuth2 `scope` claim may contain a space separated sequence.
|smallrye.jwt.claims.groups|none| This property can be used to set a default groups claim value when the current token has no standard or custom groups claim available.
|smallrye.jwt.jwks.refresh-interval|60|JWK cache refresh interval in minutes. It will be ignored unless the `mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location` points to the HTTPS URL based JWK set and no HTTP `Cache-Control` response header with a positive `max-age` parameter value is returned from a JWK HTTPS endpoint.
|smallrye.jwt.jwks.forced-refresh-interval|30|Forced JWK cache refresh interval in minutes which is used to restrict the frequency of the forced refresh attempts which may happen when the token verification fails due to the cache having no JWK key with a `kid` property matching the current token's `kid` header. It will be ignored unless the `mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location` points to the HTTPS URL based JWK set.
|smallrye.jwt.expiration.grace|60|Expiration grace in seconds. By default an expired token will still be accepted if the current time is no more than 1 min after the token expiry time.
|smallrye.jwt.verify.aud|none|Comma separated list of the audiences that a token `aud` claim may contain. This property is deprecated. Use `mp.jwt.verify.audiences` instead.
|smallrye.jwt.required.claims|none|Comma separated list of the claims that a token must contain.
