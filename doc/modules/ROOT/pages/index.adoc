= SmallRye JWT Documentation

SmallRye JWT is an implementation of https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/[Eclipse MicroProfile JWT RBAC].
Currently it is focused on supporting the MP-JWT 1.1 spec, and primarily deals with the parsing of the JWT string into
a JsonWebToken implementation.

In the future, when MP-JWT 2.0 can build on the JSR-375 security APIs, there should be more support for defining the CDI extension and security layer integration.

== Runtimes

Runtimes that currently use it as their JWT RBAC implementation include:

* https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus]
* https://wildfly.org/[WildFly]
* https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail]
