= SmallRye JWT

SmallRye JWT is a library for implementing the {microprofile-jwt}[{mp-jwt-name}]. Currently it is focused on supporting the MP-JWT 1.1 spec, and primarily deals with the parsing of the JWT string into a JsonWebToken implementation.

In the future, when MP-JWT 2.0 can build on the JSR-375 security APIs, there should be more support for defining the CDI extension and security layer integration.

== Configuration

=== MicroProfile JWT properties

[cols="<m,<m,<2",options="header"]
|===
|Property Name|Default|Description
|mp.jwt.verify.publickey|none|Public Key supplied as a string, parsed from it in the order defined in section <<Supported Public Key Formats>>.
|mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location|none|Config property allows for an external or internal location of Public Key to be specified.
|mp.jwt.verify.issuer|none|Expected value of the JWT `iss` (issuer) claim.
|===

=== Supported Public Key Formats

Public Keys may be formatted in any of the following formats, specified in order of
precedence:

 - Public Key Cryptography Standards #8 (PKCS#8) PEM
 - JSON Web Key (JWK) or JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)
 - Base64 URL encoded JSON Web Key (JWK) or JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)

=== Smallrye JWT properties

Smallrye JWT supports many properties which can be used to customize the token processing:

[cols="<m,<m,<2",options="header"]
|===
|Property Name|Default|Description
|smallrye.jwt.verify.algorithm|`RS256`|Signature algorithm. Set it to `ES256` to support the Elliptic Curve signature algorithm.
|smallrye.jwt.verify.key-format|`ANY`|Set this property to a specific key format such as `PEM_KEY`, `PEM_CERTIFICATE`, `JWK` or `JWK_BASE64URL` to optimize the way the verification key is loaded.
|smallrye.jwt.token.header|`Authorization`|Set this property if another header such as `Cookie` is used to pass the token.
|smallrye.jwt.token.cookie|none|Name of the cookie containing a token. This property will be effective only if  `smallrye.jwt.token.header` is set to `Cookie`.
|smallrye.jwt.always-check-authorization|false|Set this property to `true` for `Authorization` header be checked even if the `smallrye.jwt.token.header` is set to `Cookie` but no cookie with a `smallrye.jwt.token.cookie` name exists.
|smallrye.jwt.token.schemes|`Bearer`|Comma-separated list containing an alternative single or multiple schemes, for example, `DPoP`.
|smallrye.jwt.token.kid|none|Key identifier. If it is set then the verification JWK key as well every JWT token must have a matching `kid` header.
|smallrye.jwt.time-to-live|none|The maximum number of seconds that a JWT may be issued for use. Effectively, the difference between the expiration date of the JWT and the issued at date must not exceed this value.
|smallrye.jwt.require.named-principal|`false`|If an application relies on `java.security.Principal` returning a name then a token must have a `upn` or `preferred_username` or `sub` claim set. Setting this property will result in Smallrye JWT throwing an exception if none of these claims is available for the application code to reliably deal with a non-null `Principal` name.
|smallrye.jwt.path.sub|none|Path to the claim containing the subject name. It starts from the top level JSON object and can contain multiple segments where each segment represents a JSON object name only, example: `realms/subject`. This property can be used if a token has no 'sub' claim but has the subject set in a different claim. Use double quotes with the namespace qualified claims.
|smallrye.jwt.claims.sub|none| This property can be used to set a default sub claim value when the current token has no standard or custom `sub` claim available. Effectively this property can be used to customize `java.security.Principal` name if no `upn` or `preferred_username` or `sub` claim is set.
|smallrye.jwt.path.groups|none|Path to the claim containing the groups. It starts from the top level JSON object and can contain multiple segments where each segment represents a JSON object name only, example: `realm/groups`. This property can be used if a token has no 'groups' claim but has the groups set in a different claim. Use double quotes with the namespace qualified claims.
|smallrye.jwt.groups-separator|' '|Separator for splitting a string which may contain multiple group values. It will only be used if the `smallrye.jwt.path.groups` property points to a custom claim whose value is a string. The default value is a single space because a standard OAuth2 `scope` claim may contain a space separated sequence.
|smallrye.jwt.claims.groups|none| This property can be used to set a default groups claim value when the current token has no standard or custom groups claim available.
|smallrye.jwt.jwks.refresh-interval|60|JWK cache refresh interval in minutes. It will be ignored unless the `mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location` points to the HTTPS URL based JWK set and no HTTP `Cache-Control` response header with a positive `max-age` parameter value is returned from a JWK HTTPS endpoint.
|smallrye.jwt.expiration.grace|60|Expiration grace in seconds. By default an expired token will still be accepted if the current time is no more than 1 min after the token expiry time.
|smallrye.jwt.verify.aud|none|Comma separated list of the audiences that a token `aud` claim may contain.
|smallrye.jwt.required.claims|none|Comma separated list of the claims that a token must contain.
|smallrye.jwt.encrypt.key-location|none|Config property allows the location of a key to be specified which will be used to encrypt the claims or inner JWT.
|smallrye.jwt.sign.key-location|none|Config property allows the location of a private key to be specified which will be used to sign the claims of a JWT.
